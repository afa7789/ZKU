Assignments for the ZK University, I'm using this repository to save everything I'm learning in ZKU for future reference.

This is the older test, I made it before I could apply to study

### [background](/background/README.md)
This is the test I took to enter in ZKU, with other files related to it.
Click in the title too see the answers and code as README.
